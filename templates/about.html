        <p>
            Hi there! I'm <strong>Eli Nelson</strong>, or just <strong>Eli</strong> to most people. I'm a passionate individual with diverse interests including <strong>Minecraft</strong>, <strong>modding</strong>,
            <strong>coding</strong>, <strong>reading</strong> big books like Brandon Sanderson's *Way of Kings*, and playing <strong>Dungeons & Dragons</strong> (DND).
        </p>
        <p>
            Though I'm still learning, I'm excited to grow as a Python developer.
            Coding HTML is okay, but let's just say I've got a love-hate relationship with CSS (trust me, you're not the only one!).
            I also enjoy advertising and sharing fun jokes with my friends.
        </p>
        <p>
            What truly motivates me is the future – the possibility of seeing one of my websites used by more than 1000 people someday.
            It’s a challenge I’m ready to take on!
        </p>
        <p>
            This site is where I hope to share a bit about myself and showcase my projects as I continue learning.
            Feel free to hang around and explore!
